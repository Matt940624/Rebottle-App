## Overview

Rebottle is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter and Firebase that encourages recycling and sustainability through a rewards-based system. The app allows users to scan QR codes on recyclable bottles, earn points, and reach milestones while helping reduce waste and promoting environmental awareness.

## Features

- **QR Code Scanning**: Users can scan unique QR codes attached to recyclable bottles using their smartphone camera
- **Rewards System**: Earn points with each scan and track progress toward sustainability milestones
- **Role-Based Access**: Different experiences for customers and store owners
- **Store Owner Dashboard**: Track scans and customer milestones
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and account management through Firebase
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on both iOS and Android devices

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter/Dart
- **Backend**: Firebase
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore
- **Storage**: AWS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (version 2.17 or higher)
- Firebase CLI
- Android Studio / Xcode (for deployment)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Matt940624/Rebottle-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Rebottle-App
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: Users create an account selecting either customer or store owner role
2. **Bottle Registration** (Store Owners): Store owners can register bottles with unique QR codes
3. **Scanning**: Customers scan the QR code on bottles when recycling them
4. **Rewards**: Points are awarded for each scan, with milestones that unlock benefits
5. **Analytics**: Store owners can view analytics on recycling rates and user engagement
